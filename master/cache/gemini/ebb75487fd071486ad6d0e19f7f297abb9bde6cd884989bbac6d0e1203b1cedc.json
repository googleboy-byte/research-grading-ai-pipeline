  "response": "{\n    \"content_quality\": 7,\n    \"content_justification\": \"The paper presents a novel approach to improve the retrieval process in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. The proposed method leverages a previously developed relevancy score (RS) model to re-rank retrieved entries and select more relevant context for response generation. The paper provides a clear explanation of the limitations of existing retrieval methods and how the RS model addresses these challenges. The evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval relevancy and response quality across various RAG implementations.\",\n    \"presentation\": 8,\n    \"presentation_justification\": \"The paper is well-written and organized. It provides a clear introduction to the problem, describes the proposed method in detail, and presents the evaluation results in a structured manner. The use of figures and tables helps illustrate the key concepts and findings effectively.\",\n    \"overall_assessment\": \"Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of multi-modal RAG systems. The proposed method shows promise in improving the quality of retrieved context and generated responses, which can lead to more accurate and reliable multi-modal RAG systems.\"\n}"
