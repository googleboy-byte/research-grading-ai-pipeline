  "response": "{\n    \"main_topic\": \"Crop breeding and yield prediction\",\n    \"objective\": \"To develop a hybrid method that combines data assimilation and deep learning with a large language model (LLM) for interactive and accurate predictions of wheat breeding yields.\",\n    \"methodology\": \"The study used a newly designed data assimilation algorithm (WW-4VES) to assimilate leaf area index (LAI) into the WOFOST model. The partial output results after assimilation and the results of remote sensing inversion were then used to drive the time series temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model to predict wheat yield. Finally, based on the hybrid method and leveraging LLM with RAG technology, an interactive yield prediction Web tool was developed.\",\n    \"key_findings\": \"The hybrid method achieved satisfactory yield prediction performance in different regions and natural weed competition environments. The interactive yield prediction Web tool is user-friendly and supports sustainable data updates, integrating multi-source data to support breeding decision-making.\"\n}"
