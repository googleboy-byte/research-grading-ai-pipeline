Domain adaptation can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models on target domains that differ from the source domain. The proposed framework can help users to identify and classify domain adaptation problems, deliver guidance on suitable solution approaches, and help to pinpoint reasons for ill-performing domain adaptation attempts.\"\n}"
