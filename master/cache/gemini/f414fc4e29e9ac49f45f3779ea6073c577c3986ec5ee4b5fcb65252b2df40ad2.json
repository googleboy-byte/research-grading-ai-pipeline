  "response": "{\n    \"main_topic\": \"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their performance enhancement inspired by the biological nervous system architecture of planarians.\",\n    \"objective\": \"To improve the image classification performance of ANNs by developing ANNs with evolution patterns similar to those of biological neural networks.\",\n    \"methodology\": \"The proposed planarian neural architecture-based neural network was evaluated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The performance of the proposed method was compared to baseline neural network models in image classification tasks.\",\n    \"key_findings\": \"The proposed method exhibits higher prediction accuracy than the baseline neural network models in image classification tasks. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of biologically inspired neural network architectures in improving the performance of ANNs in a wide range of applications.\"\n}"
