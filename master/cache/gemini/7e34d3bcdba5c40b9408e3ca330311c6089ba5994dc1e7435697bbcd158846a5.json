It introduces a distillation loss to enhance the semantics in the learning of autoregressive models. The paper provides experimental results demonstrating the strong performance of the proposed method on a variety of tasks, including texture manipulation, object replacement, object removal, local editing, canny-to-image, depth-to-image, and segmentation-to-image.\",\n    \"presentation\": 7,\n    \"presentation_justification\": \"The paper is well-structured and clearly written. It provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed method and its evaluation on various tasks.
