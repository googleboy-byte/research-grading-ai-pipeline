  "response": "{\n    \"content_quality\": 7,\n    \"content_justification\": \"The paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the design choices for unrolled networks in solving linear inverse problems. It introduces the Deep Memory Unrolled Network (DeMUN), which leverages the history of all gradients and generalizes a wide range of existing unrolled networks. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of DeMUNs and provide practical guidelines for selecting the loss function, structuring the unrolled network, determining the required number of projections, and deciding on the appropriate number of layers. The paper also explores the robustness of DeMUNs to different measurement matrices, additive noise levels, and image resolutions.\",\n    \"presentation\": 8,\n    \"presentation_justification\": \"The paper is well-organized and clearly written. It starts with an introduction to the problem and the proposed approach, followed by a detailed description of the simulation setup and results. The paper also includes several figures and tables to illustrate the findings.\",\n    \"overall_assessment\": \"Overall, the paper is of good quality and provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of unrolled networks for linear inverse problems. The content is comprehensive and well-presented, making it a useful reference for researchers and practitioners in the field.\"\n}"
