The approach is evaluated using a dataset collected from PD patients and healthy controls, and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. The paper is well-written and provides a clear description of the proposed approach and the experimental results.\",\n    \"presentation\": 8,\n    \"presentation_justification\": \"The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
