  "response": "{\n    \"main_topic\": \"Computational linguistics, specifically the analysis of written justifications in crowdsourced forecasts\",\n    \"objective\": \"To demonstrate the importance of written explanations in improving the accuracy of aggregated crowdsourced forecasts\",\n    \"methodology\": \"The study utilizes data from the Good Judgment Open, a platform where questions are posted, and individuals submit their forecasts. The dataset contains 441 questions and 96,664 forecasts submitted over 32,708 days. The authors employ a neural network architecture to process the sequence of forecasts and ultimately call the question. The architecture consists of three main components: one to generate a representation of the question, another to generate a representation of each forecast, and an LSTM to process the sequence of forecasts.\",\n    \"key_findings\": \"The study finds that incorporating the written explanations provided by individuals when making predictions enhances the accuracy of aggregated crowd-sourced forecasts. The inclusion of written justifications improves forecast accuracy throughout most of a question\u2019s duration, with the exception of its final phase.\"\n}"
