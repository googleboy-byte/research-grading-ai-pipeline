  "response": "{\n    \"main_topic\": \"Indoor localization in home environments for people with Parkinson's disease (PD)\",\n    \"objective\": \"To develop a system for unobtrusive and continuous indoor localization in home environments for people with PD, using IoT-based platforms with sensors capturing various modalities of data, combined with machine learning.\",\n    \"methodology\": \"The proposed system uses Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) signals emitted by wearables and measured at access points (AP) throughout a home to estimate the user's position. Accelerometer data from wearable devices is also used to distinguish different activities (e.g., walking vs standing) and enhance RSSI's ability to differentiate between adjacent rooms. A deep learning network is used to intelligently select accelerometer features that can enhance RSSI performance in indoor localization.\",\n    \"key_findings\": \"The proposed system outperforms other methods across all cross-validation categories, including training on data from people with PD and healthy controls. The system can also be used to transform accurate room-level localization predictions into in-home gait speed biomarkers (e.g., number of room-to-room transitions, room-to-room transition duration), which can effectively classify the OFF or ON medication state of a PD patient.\"\n}"
