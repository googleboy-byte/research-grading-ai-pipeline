  "response": "{\n    \"main_topic\": \"Grokking in deep learning\",\n    \"objective\": \"To explain the delayed generalization and reliance on regularization in grokking, and to introduce new methods to induce grokking without regularization.\",\n    \"methodology\": \"The paper analyzes the phenomenon of grokking in deep learning, where models suddenly generalize after prolonged overfitting. The authors hypothesize that grokking is prevented by floating point errors in the Softmax function, which they call Softmax Collapse (SC). They also propose a new activation function, StableMax, and a new optimizer, \u22a5Grad, to address these issues.\",\n    \"key_findings\": \"The authors find that SC is responsible for the delayed generalization and reliance on regularization in grokking. They also show that StableMax and \u22a5Grad can induce grokking without regularization in settings where it is normally not observed.\"\n}"
