  "response": "{\n    \"main_topic\": \"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their performance enhancement inspired by biological neural networks\",\n    \"objective\": \"To improve the image classification performance of ANNs by incorporating evolutionary patterns observed in planarian neural networks\",\n    \"methodology\": \"The study proposed a Planarian Neural Network (PNN) framework based on the biological nervous system of planarians. The PNN architecture consisted of an artificial brain and two or more artificial nerve cords. The brain balanced global optimization based on knowledge learned from the nerve cords, while each nerve cord performed specific functions. The PNN framework was evaluated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets using Python 3.8.11 and PyTorch 1.12.0 on a Ubuntu 20.04 workstation with four RTX 3090 graphics cards.\",\n    \"key_findings\": \"The proposed PNN framework exhibited higher prediction accuracy than baseline neural network models in image classification tasks. The best-performing PNNs on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 had patience gate values of 15 (PNN15) and 20 (PNN20), respectively. The study demonstrated the potential of biologically inspired neural network architectures in improving the performance of ANNs.\"\n}"
