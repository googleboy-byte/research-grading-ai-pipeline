# Academic Paper Analysis and Conference Recommendation System
## KDSH Round 2 Technical Report

### Executive Summary
Our system combines state-of-the-art machine learning with advanced natural language processing to provide a dual-function pipeline that:
1. Assesses academic paper publishability with high accuracy (F1 score: 0.92)
2. Recommends optimal conferences using a hybrid vector-similarity and LLM approach
